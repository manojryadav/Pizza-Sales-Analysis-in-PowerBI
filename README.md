# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-in-PowerBI
Project Task
For the Maven Pizza Challenge, I am taking on the role of a BI Consultant, having been engaged by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizzeria located in New Jersey. In this capacity, I have been tasked with leveraging data analysis to enhance the restaurant's operational efficiency and revenue generation. 
We have outlined several key questions that we aim to answer through your analysis:

1. What are the days and times during which we experience the highest customer traffic?
2. Can you determine the volume of pizzas produced during our busiest periods?
3. Which pizzas are our top sellers, and which ones are underperforming?
4. What is the average order value for our customers?
5. Are we effectively utilizing our seating capacity, given that we have 15 tables with a total of 60 seats?

My project is focused on utilizing data-driven insights to drive Plato's Pizza towards greater success.
